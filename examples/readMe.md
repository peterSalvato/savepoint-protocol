# Examples

This folder contains real-world Savepoint examples written using the Savepoint Protocol v2.2.

Each example demonstrates how to properly capture the full arc of a conversation, including:
- Timestamped decision points
- User intent and contextual nuance
- Embedded runnable outputs (e.g., routines, code, frameworks)

These examples are designed to:
- Clarify how the protocol works in practice
- Provide templates for different use cases
- Ensure that future Savepoints are both narratively rich and practically actionable
