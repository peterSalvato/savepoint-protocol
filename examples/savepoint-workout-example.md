March 29 @ 12:12 PM – User explained they are out of shape, underweight, and want a structured full-body plan:
- Equipment: Two 16kg kettlebells, Weighted Vest, Power Tower
- Main goal: Build glutes/legs, correct posture (specifically “the part below my navel protrudes”), and gain overall muscle size.

March 29 @ 12:29 PM – A detailed full-body program was drafted, with emphasis on:
- Glute & leg hypertrophy (step-ups, Bulgarian split squats, glute bridges, Nordic ham curls)
- Core & posture (hollow holds, deadbugs, negative pull-ups)
- 3–4x/week schedule, progressive overload using vest/kettlebells

March 29 @ 12:42 PM – User decided to start with bodyweight-only exercises for ~4 weeks to rebuild baseline strength and confidence.
