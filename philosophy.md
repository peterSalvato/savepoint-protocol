# Savepoint Protocol – Philosophy

This document defines the intent, ethical boundary, and cognitive role of the Savepoint Protocol.

It is not a productivity framework.  
It is not a generative system.  
It is a structural mechanism for cognitive preservation, review, and authorship defense.

---

## 1. Primary Function

The protocol exists to:

- Document cognitive activity with minimal friction
- Mark significant or anomalous events in thought
- Enable post-hoc reflection and synthesis
- Surface latent insight that was not visible in real time
- Preserve authorship provenance for all outputs derived from saved ideas

It is designed for humans.  
It allows machine assistance.  
It does not allow machine authorship.

---

## 2. Use Conditions

Any creative output derived through the Savepoint Protocol must be:

- Human-authored at the point of origin
- Traceable to a sequence of savepoints
- Defensible as non-synthetic in both process and content

Machine systems may:

- Suggest savepoints
- Surface relationships
- Classify or reflect on human-authored logs

Machine systems may not:

- Originate conceptual direction
- Compose outputs autonomously
- Suppress or overwrite authorship metadata

---

## 3. Cognitive Architecture

Savepoints operate across multiple cognitive environments:

| Tier | Mode                        | Role                                |
|------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1    | Pen and paper               | Manual notation, visual scan        |
| 2    | Plaintext + shell tools     | Symbolic traversal, grep/awk/etc.   |
| 3    | Chat/LLM export             | Reflection layer, synthesis assist  |
| 4    | LLM-assisted flagging       | Pattern surfacing during session    |

Transitions between tiers are permitted in both directions.

Each tier functions independently. No tier is required.

---

## 4. Reflection and Extraction

Savepoints are not summaries.  
They are anchors for **post-hoc clarity**.

Human cognition in real time is partial and volatile.  
The Savepoint Protocol allows the externalization of partial structure so that it may later be completed, corrected, or reclassified with greater distance and precision.

The protocol is built for recursive use:
- A savepoint may reflect on another
- A session may be reinterpreted through export
- A pattern may be retroactively identified

---

## 5. Ethical Clause

Creative material captured using this system is presumed to be human-generated unless annotated otherwise.

No system using this protocol may:

- Obscure authorship
- Replace ideation with generation
- Embed savepoints into proprietary AI training models

Savepoints are markers of cognitive activity, not content to be consumed.  
They are intended for retrieval, not automation.

---

## 6. Operational Boundary

This protocol is designed to remain durable across:

- Hardware failure
- Format change
- Tool transition
- Platform abandonment

It is written in plaintext.  
It can be stored, scanned, transcribed, and reindexed without loss.  
No server, API, or vendor dependency is required.

---

## 7. Closing Statement

The Savepoint Protocol is a semantic defense mechanism for thinking systems.

It is intended for use by individuals engaged in complex idea work under conditions of distraction, recursion, or long timelines.

It is not reactive.  
It is not aesthetic.  
It is structural.

Preserve the line.  
Reenter the thread.  
The authorship is yours.
