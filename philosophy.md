# Savepoint Protocol™ — Philosophy

This document defines the operational intent and ethical constraints of the Savepoint Protocol™.

It is not a framework for automation.  
It is not a creative toolset.  
It is a semantic structure for defending, preserving, and surfacing human cognition.

---

## 1. Core Purpose

The protocol exists to:

- Anchor moments of cognitive importance
- Surface latent insight lost in active ideation
- Create traversable records of nonlinear thought
- Defend authorship and intellectual lineage
- Extend human memory, not simulate it

Savepoints do not create content.  
They extract and document cognition in transit.

---

## 2. Authorship Constraint

Creative output generated using this protocol must be:

- Human-authored at the point of origin
- Traceable to a log of recorded decisions or insights
- Free from automated synthesis unless explicitly annotated

Systems may assist with:

- Tagging
- Classification
- Traversal
- Synthesis review

They may not:

- Originate creative direction
- Compose outputs
- Rewrite authorship records

---

## 3. Operational Context

The protocol functions across four cognitive environments:

| Tier | Mode                        | Description                          |
|------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1    | Analog                      | Manual journaling, visual review     |
| 2    | Plaintext / Shell           | CLI search, grep, awk, etc.          |
| 3    | LLM Session Export          | Marked reflection, metadata parsing  |
| 4    | LLM-In-Session Flagging     | Pattern recognition, tagging assist  |

Tiers may be entered or exited nonlinearly.  
The system is not dependent on a specific stack.

---

## 4. Reflection Protocol

Savepoints are designed to allow delayed recognition of signal.

- Thought marked in uncertainty may be reclassified later.
- Incomplete or emergent ideas may be retrieved post-hoc.
- Machine assistance may surface patterns previously invisible to the author.

The protocol assumes **imperfect visibility at the time of writing**.  
It is built for recursive clarity.

---

## 5. Ethical Clause

The Savepoint Protocol™ is a protective structure.

It may not be:

- Used in generative AI training datasets
- Embedded in commercial tools without permission
- Obscured or co-opted by automated outputs

It is permitted for:

- Individual or collaborative human use
- Non-commercial cognitive enhancement
- Protected archival of creative process

Attribution must be maintained.  
Derivative systems must preserve structural integrity.

---

## 6. Durability

This protocol is engineered to:

- Operate without dependencies
- Function in degraded systems
- Persist through tool changes or obsolescence
- Remain legible across digital and analog interfaces

The system is structural, not aesthetic.  
It is permanent under entropy conditions.

---

## 7. Summary

The Savepoint Protocol™ is a semantic architecture for preserving the signal of human cognition.

It is not designed to optimize workflow.  
It is designed to **secure authorship, protect memory, and recover what matters**—even when it was not visible in real time.
