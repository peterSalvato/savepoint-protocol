# Savepoint Protocol

**The Savepoint Protocol** is a semantic markup system for documenting, navigating, and defending human thought across time.

It allows creative thinkers, researchers, and systems designers to **anchor meaningful moments**—insights, shifts, contradictions, or decisions—within any medium (pen and paper, text files, chat logs, or AI conversations).

Savepoint is designed to:
- 🧠 Capture **emergent, intuitive thought**
- 🧵 Create **traversable threads of reflection**
- 🛡️ Defend **human authorship** in the age of generative AI
- 🛠️ Work across **low- and high-tech environments** (paper → AI)

## 💡 Why Use Savepoints?

Savepoints allow you to:
- Anchor your thinking in real time
- Return to significant moments with context
- Preserve authorship and intellectual lineage
- Reflect on how your ideas evolved
- Enhance human memory without surrendering agency

## ✍️ Markup Format

Savepoints use a simple open/close block structure:

<savepoint> type: insight importance: high influence: Moebius

The glyph system isn't a visual language—it's a philosophical structure. </savepoint>


- Attributes are optional, one per line
- Text body is separated by a blank line
- Fully grep/regex-compatible
- Works in plaintext, chat, notebooks, or markup editors

Full spec: [`savepoint-spec-v1.md`](./savepoint-spec-v1.md)

## 🔐 Authorship Integrity

This protocol is designed to **protect and extract** human-authored ideas.

Savepoints do not generate content.  
They **record, reveal, and retrace** human cognition—across mediums and time.

> Machines may assist in tagging or synthesis,  
> but must not originate creative direction unless explicitly annotated.

Full statement: [`philosophy.md`](./philosophy.md)
