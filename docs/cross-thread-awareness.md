# Cross-Thread Awareness

One of the most powerful aspects of the Savepoint Protocol is its ability to capture *what you understood across all threads at a specific moment*.

Each Savepoint includes a “Related Threads” section. This enables:

- Temporal clarity – what you believed on a given day  
- Narrative continuity – how threads shaped each other  
- Strategic insight – what shifted your direction  
- Philosophical integrity – what was consistent across projects

Example:

> Savepoint – April 2, 2025 @ 5:17 PM  
> Related Threads: Codex Drafting, Creative Systems, Ætherwright Wardrobe, Personal Branding

This indicates a convergence—those projects were all influencing the thinking at that moment.
