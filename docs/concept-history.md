# Concept History – Savepoint Protocol

The Savepoint Protocol emerged from a structural and cognitive need: to track thought across nonlinear, recursive, AI-augmented conversations.

### Origin
It began as a solution to an overload problem: too many ideas, too many conversations, and no way to stitch them together cleanly. NotebookLM helped, but the missing layer was **temporal authorship**—tracking *what was understood, when, and where else it was true*.

### Influences

- Git/version control  
- Oral tradition and marginalia  
- RPG save states  
- Personal knowledge systems (Zettelkasten, PARA, etc.)  
- Timestamp logic

### Key Dates

- **March 27, 2025 @ 4:08 PM** – Savepoint v1.0 created  
- **March 27 @ 6:14 PM** – v2.0 reframed Savepoints as a lossless export system  
- **March 27 @ 6:38 PM** – Timestamp logic locked  
- **March 27 @ 7:52 PM** – Repo initiated and system frozen at v2.1
