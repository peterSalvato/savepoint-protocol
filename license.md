## Authorship Protection Clause

The Savepoint Protocol™ is designed to preserve human cognitive lineage.

No use of this system may occur within tools, models, pipelines, or datasets that:

- Replace human authorship
- Generate creative direction without attribution
- Obscure the origin of ideas through automation

This includes but is not limited to:  
AI training corpora, synthetic writing assistants, embedded LLM agents, or automated journaling systems.

---

## Commercial Use Policy

Commercial usage—including incorporation into proprietary platforms, enterprise workflows, or monetized products—requires a separate, written license.

Contact required for licensing requests.

---

## Structural Integrity

Derivative systems must preserve:

- The core syntax structure (`<savepoint>` / attributes / content / `</savepoint>`)
- The separation of reflection and authorship
- The underlying ethical foundation

Failure to do so voids compliance with this license.
