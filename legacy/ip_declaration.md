Savepoint.Protocol is an original reflection, logging, and cognitive scaffolding system authored by Peter Salvato. It uses semantic tagging via a handwritten `<savepoint>` syntax to track mental shifts, ideation forks, and expressive events in creative workflows.

This protocol includes:

- Syntax specification (`<savepoint>` tag and its grammar)
- Defined vocabulary for types (`realization`, `fork`, `language`, etc.)
- Directional semantics (`lookback`, `lookahead`, `bidirectional`)
- Optional attributes (e.g., `x-theme`, `callback`, `importance`)
- Application guidance for creative, intellectual, and philosophical work

This intellectual property is authored and timestamped by Peter Salvato, with intent to assign to **Third Limited, LLC** upon its formal registration. This declaration is versioned via Git and formatted for machine-readable Savepoint.Protocol compliance.
