# Savepoint Protocol

**Savepoint Protocol** is a system for capturing, preserving, and synthesizing human thought across AI-assisted creative sessions. It provides a structured, timestamped format to help you track evolving ideas across overlapping conversations—especially when using tools like ChatGPT and NotebookLM.

This system is not for generating ideas *from* AI. It’s for **extracting and preserving original thinking**, then reflecting and expanding on it over time.

## Core Concepts

- **Timestamped Awareness** – Capture *when* you understood something, not just when it was said  
- **Cross-Thread Integration** – Link conversations and ideas across domains or projects  
- **Lossless Ideation Capture** – Nothing gets lost between chats, tools, or moments  
- **Recursive Reflection** – Synthesize learning and insight into a feedback loop that sharpens itself

## Who It’s For

- Writers, designers, and systems thinkers  
- Neurodivergent or scattered creatives  
- Anyone managing complex or overlapping thought across time  
- Users of ChatGPT and NotebookLM who want structured clarity

## How It Works (Core Loop)

1. **Ideate in ChatGPT**
2. **End with a Savepoint** (timestamped recap)
3. **Copy Savepoint into NotebookLM** (or similar second-brain system)
4. **Synthesize insights across threads**
5. **Save new documents** in this repo or system
6. **Repeat**, building a compound understanding over time

## Structure

- `.savepoints/` – Raw savepoint captures from ChatGPT  
- `docs/` – Instruction sets, conceptual grounding, methodology  
- `templates/` – Savepoint templates and Codex headers  
- `assets/` – Visuals, diagrams, and symbolic glyph systems
